# E-Commerce App (Django)
![E-Commerce App](./assets/e-commerce_Django/ecommerce02.png)


   Welcome to the E-Commerce App repository! This web application was built with Django as part of my learning journey. I created it in December 2022, following the instructions of a course on FreeCode Camp. Through this project, I aimed to grasp the philosophy of Django and understand the roles of essential files like `settings.py`, `views.py`, `urls.py`, and `models.py`.

## Why Django?

Having prior experience with Flask, I found Django to be a more user-friendly framework for web development. Django manages a significant portion of the backend structure, making it easier to build projects without worrying about security, routing connections, and more. The ability to reuse code also contributes to faster and more scalable development.
